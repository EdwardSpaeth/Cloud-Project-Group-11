\textbf{Contents}

A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and
solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

\begin{itemize}
\item

\item
  decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage
  of an architectural pattern or design pattern
\item
  decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
\item
  relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development
  process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Motivation}

These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are
the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation
rules.
