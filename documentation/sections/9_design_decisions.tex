\section{Architecture Decisions}\label{section-design-decisions}}

\textbf{Contents}

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions
including rationales. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative
based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision
should be documented here in this central section or whether you better
document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building
block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the
most important decisions of your architecture.

\textbf{Motivation}

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace
your decisions.

\textbf{Form}

Various options:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ADR
  (\href{https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions}{Documenting
  Architecture Decisions}) for every important decision
\item
  List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
\item
  more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
\end{itemize}

See \href{https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/}{Architecture Decisions} in
the arc42 documentation. There you will find links and examples about
ADR.
