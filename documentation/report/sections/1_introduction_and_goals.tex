\subsection{Overview}
This project focuses on developing a \textbf{Webshop system} for \textbf{LowTech GmbH} using \textbf{cloud computing}. The objective is to create a \textbf{fully functional e-commerce platform} that is \textbf{scalable, highly available, and responsive}. The system follows a \textbf{Three-Tier Architecture} and is deployed on \textbf{Microsoft Azure}, leveraging cloud services for hosting, storage, and computing power.

\subsection{Project Scope and Requirements}
The Webshop system is designed to meet the following key requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Availability:} The system should have a \textbf{99.99\% uptime}, ensuring minimal downtime.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} It should dynamically scale to handle increased user traffic.
    \item \textbf{User-Friendly Interface:} The frontend should be \textbf{fast, responsive, and accessible on multiple devices}.
    \item \textbf{Separation of Concerns:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Frontend (User Interface):} Built using \textbf{Next.js} and \textbf{Tailwind CSS}.
