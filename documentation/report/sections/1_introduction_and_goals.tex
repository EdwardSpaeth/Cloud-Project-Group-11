\subsection{Overview}
This project focuses on developing a webshop system for the LowTech GmbH using cloud computing. The objective is to create a fully functional e-commerce platform that is scalable, highly available, and responsive. The system follows a Three-Tier Architecture and is deployed on Microsoft Azure, leveraging cloud services for hosting, storage, and computing power.

\subsection{Project Scope and Requirements}
The Webshop system is designed to meet the following key requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Availability}: The system should have a 99.9\% uptime, ensuring minimal downtime.
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: It should dynamically scale to handle increased user traffic.
    \item \textbf{User-Friendly Interface}: The frontend should be fast, responsive, and accessible on multiple devices.
    \item \textbf{Separation of Concerns}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Frontend (User Interface)}: Built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
