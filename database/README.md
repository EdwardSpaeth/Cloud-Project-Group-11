# Database
**Note: This directory serves no purpose anymore for this project!**
This directory was used for setting up a local database.
For local development purposes, we opted to host a Postgres database locally using Docker.
Later on, we migrated fully into using the SaaS offering of Azure SQL.

The only useful file left is <code>database/tables_for_azure.sql</code>, since this is the reference file for how the tables look like on Azure.

This directory was not deleted for documentation purposes.
